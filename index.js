ðŸ‘¤ Captain, weâ€™ve intercepted a signal from an ancient alien AI. 
It has locked down our ship and issued a challenge.

ðŸ¤– "GUESS THE PRIME COORDINATE â€” A NUMBER BETWEEN 1 AND 100."

You have 10 attempts before the reactor overloads. Each failed attempt drains 
your energy core by 10%.

ðŸŒŒ Success means freedom. Failure... well, let's not go there.

ðŸ§  Engage logic. Trust your instincts. And may the data be with you.
